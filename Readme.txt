 This is a short information visualization of StackOverflow posts in a one week period. It allows users to select topic Tags and view the posts and comments associated with each Tag. 

 Select a button to visualize. The program will assign color and circle size to each Tag, and shift position based on quantity of posts and comments.

 This program requires Processing, a Java based application, to run, as well is the "controlP5" GUI Library, downloadable from the Processing GUI window.
